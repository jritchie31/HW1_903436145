         <!-- Personal Description -->
         <p>
            I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Computational Science and Engineering and M.S. in Civil Engineering at Georgia Tech. I graduated with a B.S. in Civil Engineering from Georgia Tech in Fall 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, I have gained valuable experience through 7 internships in different disciplines ranging from technical program management, industrial engineering, to structural engineering.

            My primary interests lie in the area of smart structural systems and the integration of machine learning into structural engineering. I'm also passionate about bioinformatics, statistics, and the list continues to grow.

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and data-driven decision-making. I am particularly focused on developing innovative solutions for real-time data processing and predictive modeling, with applications in transportation, healthcare, and infrastructure. I have a strong interest in semi-supervised learning techniques for data annotation, as demonstrated in my work on pavement crack segmentation. Additionally, I am passionate about leveraging machine learning algorithms to improve system efficiency, such as optimizing dwell time prediction for transit systems. I am also keen on applying computer vision techniques to medical diagnostics, as evidenced by my work on classifying patients with Cerebral Palsy, and I am excited to explore further advancements in these areas.</p>
